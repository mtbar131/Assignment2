/**
 * Created by aabhijitbarve on 8/13/2015.
 * Create a service HugeInteger which uses a 40-element array of digits to
 * <p>
 * store integers as large as 40 digits each. Provide methods parse, toString, add and subtract. Method
 * <p>
 * parse should receive a String, extract each digit using method charAt and place the integer
 * <p>
 * equivalent of each digit into the integer array. For comparing HugeInteger objects, provide the following
 * <p>
 * methods: isEqualTo, isNotEqualTo, isGreaterThan, isLessThan, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo
 * <p>
 * and isLessThanOrEqualTo. Each of these is a predicate method that returns true if the relationship
 * <p>
 * holds between the two HugeInteger objects and returns false if the relationship does not hold. Provide
 * <p>
 * a predicate method isZero. If you feel ambitious, also provide methods multiply, divide and
 * <p>
 * remainder. [Note: Primitive boolean values can be output as the word “true” or the word “false” with
 * <p>
 * format specifier %b.]
